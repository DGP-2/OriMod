Specific movement traits in Blind Forest to be implemented here

Dash:
  Dash lasts for 24 frames
  On a ground dash, a ground jump can be done 6 frames after no longer grounded

CDash:
  CDash also lasts 24 frames
  CDash should target the nearest enemy with line of sight
  If cancelled 12 frames in (via Bash or Stomp), energy spent on that CDash is refunded
  If jumping, momentum at that time is preserved

Glide:
  Glide is only available, and always available, when not grounded and falling

Bash:
  Lasts a minimum of 2/3 of a second (40 frames)
  If Bash button is released and pressed an instant later, a double bash is performed
  If Bash button is released and the bash angle changes the frame after, a trash bash is performed
  If no movement button is held, horizontal speed caused from the bash is preserved
    Bash Gliding is a known speedrunning technique as a result
