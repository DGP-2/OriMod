--- Summary ---

To start, craft a Spirit Sprout using 10 wood and either one
enchanted weapon (sword, boomerang, arkhalis), or three basic
movement items (bottle items, climbing items, or basic boots not
including rocket), then place it and right click on it.

Sein will assist you on your journey. At the Spirit Sprout, use 8
Silver or Tungsten. As you continue your adventure, Sein will
have the opportunity to grow stronger with you. To do this,
upgrade the Spirit Orb using various materials.

Unlock and upgrade various abilities by creating
Spirit Medallions. These Medallions are created at the
Spirit Sprout, and new ones will become available throughout
your journey.

Microsoft owns all property to Ori. The creators of this mod
simply loved Ori and we wanted to make it work in Terraria.

If you enjoy this mod, we encourage you to play
Ori and the Blind Forest, and Ori and the Will of the Wisps.
