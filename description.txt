Ori and the Blind Forest crossover pack.
To start, craft a Spirit Sprout using 10 wood and either
one enchanted weapon (sword, boomerang, arkhalis), or
three basic movement items (bottle items, climbing items,
or basic boots not including rocket), then place it and
right click on it.

Sein will assist you on your journey. At the Spirit Sprout,
use 8 Silver or Tungston. As you continue
your adventure, Sein will have the opportunity to grow
stronger with you.

Moon Studio owns all property to Ori, The creators of this mod simply love Ori
and we wanted to make it work in Terraria.
