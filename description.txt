To start, craft a Spirit Sprout using 10 wood and either
one enchanted weapon (sword, boomerang, arkhalis), or
three basic movement items (bottle items, climbing items,
or basic boots not including rocket), then place it and
right click on it.

Sein will assist you on your journey. At the Spirit Sprout,
use 8 Silver or Tungsten. As you continue your adventure, 
Sein will have the opportunity to grow stronger with you.
To do this, upgrade the Spirit Orb using certain bars.

Moon Studio owns all property to Ori, The creators of this
